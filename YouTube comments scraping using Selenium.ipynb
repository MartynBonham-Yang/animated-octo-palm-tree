It gives me a more informed view of what is going on in that part of the world from the lens of one who lives in the region rather than from a purely western perspective. Great stuff!!\n",

Thank you for not judging on what nupur Sharma said is right or wrong .....i will read between the lines ...question is will these countries stay silent if india takes legal  action against people on other side ...they also need to reciprocate the interest...Also India could have done this more meticulously...

In fact what Nupur Sharma said is very mild one in Quran. Instead of asking apology they should come forward for a open debate regarding Quran. Let everyone shall know what actually Quran is. The current issue faced by \"peaceful community\" is that  they are ashamed of what written in it but also very intolerable to someone who discuss about Quran. 😂😂😂\n",

From the ball-park numbers, I see that India is such a gifted national territory; such diversity. Also flabbergasted, mortified that you are being ruled by morons and potentially, even fascists.\n",

When the secularists (like recently Mohua Moitra of TMC) make obscene remark or insults lord Siva and other gods there are no repercussions. Clearly Hindus don't have same level of money power or political influence.\n",

Does it want to be a great democracy or does it want to go down the path that some of its neighbours have taken - Exclusive, narrow, religion and identity focussed. It is quite shameful that the ruling government condones minority baiters. This seems to have become a badge of honour for many supporters of the present government. It is sad that it was moved to act only after some of its key trading partners voiced their displeasure over remarks made by BJP spokespersons who were not by any stretch of the imagination fringe players.\n",

Freedom of speech should allow the recitation of the words of Quran and cannot be blasphemous but given the dependence on GCC and US and India needs to bid its time. Also unfortunately they are BJP spokes person and not a Sansad or Hindu religious person who can make the statements. The best government can do is file a case in those cases and in this they are the BJP spokesperson. I think the GCC countries cannot understand the freedom speech but that is for another day.\n",

Whatever a democratic country has to do has been done by the govt. of Indian.  It is not known whether the mistake of a citizen needs to be owned up by the govt. In this case  an argument is countered by another individual how there can be a fault  rests with one individual only and also both individuals are not arguing on govt policy on the subject\n",

Suspending Nupur Sharma and Jindal was necessary taking into account the overall political atmosphere. Antagonizing the entire gulf region does not make good real politics. The point is antagonism between Hindus and Muslims will remain as long as people on earth. Hope this does not go beyond a point. The genie is out of the bottle.

That they are the worst regarding religious tolerance is another thing. But India needs to manage its international relations well. But the muslims in india targetting hindu deities and customs is not going to end, which ends up provoking such responses against the muslim prophet. So the way to deal with this is in ensuring that muslims in India speaking ill of Hindu deities or customs should be severely punished. Put them in jail without bail for years. This will reduce and eliminate objectional remarks against muslim prophet that provokes islamic countries.\n",

              "80   I have watched a handful of \"Cut the Clutter\" episodes since Mr. Gupta started this series . I request him to please change the name of the series. Instead of decluttering the mosaic of facts and information, he invariably ends up stocking up more clutter, than was there to begin with. The first few episodes I watched , got me confused,  but I attributed it to my lack of familiarity with his style of speaking. However, now, I am quite clear, that Mr. Gupta in these 20 -22 minute videos, bombards the listener/viewer with so many facts and opinionated diversions, that the crux of the issue recedes into the background. If one listens carefully to  this episode, the answer to the question posed in the video title \" Why the Modi govt......in Gulf states\" is provided only in the last two minutes. The preceding 18-20 minutes are full of unnecessary information (that a sharp and crisp video has no need of; perhaps for a novella or a chapter in a book it could work). Furthermore, the explanation offered by him for the alacrity, could have been easily summed up in 5 minutes. The more important aspects of the issue were totally ignored.  It appears, that in the garb of cutting the clutter, Mr. Gupta is trying to brush a lot of questions under the carpet and doling out information as a means of diversion.\n",

In fact this erroneous perception of the demarcation between the party and the government wasn't expected from a senior person like Mr. Sekar Guptha.\n",

During The Goa crisis 1961, Egypt prevented Portuguese war ships from passing through the Suez Canal to Goa. First visit for Nasser to the subcontinent, was Five days in India and less than a day in Pakistan. The first fighter jet engine for both countries was E-300 developed jointly, and was used both in Helwan and Maruti fighters. After Nasser, came Sadat was also a staunch ally of Indira Gandhi. It is India's abandonment of secularism, followed by Arabs doing the same, that bodes ill to both India and the Arab world. Rise of religious fundamentalism is a malaise spreading in South Asia, the Middle East and the United States. India was a minaret of tolerance we really miss.\n",

But it  can always show the majesty of Indian state by acting equally strong against anti hindu provocateur . The way the govt has  acted right from CAA protest shows it is a spineless , opportunistic and manipulative govt looking only to win elections. Modi has not shown any statesmanship to actively  address separatism in muslim leadership on grounds of  religion  in a country supposed to be secular and modern in the true  spirit of its constitution.\n",

Tough position must be taken especially the GCC countries who are doing their bit to assuage the insult meted out to the USA. This is the optimal time for India to assert and not be worried about short-term adversities. Else India will tilt the balance within by again giving the reign to Islamist in India who are looking for a opening. This is the optimal time to prevent the intensification of leverage with fundamentalist Muslims in India. I hope India is planning a surgical strike.\n",

There was no reaction like this time , as a matter of fact no reaction at all by any Muslim country or leader .  My intuition says that congress party , Muslim. leaders , former Muslim diplomats like Hamid Ansari have a hand in this . After that it became a competition between the Muslim countries to become champion of the Muslim. Population of the world .  I do not support  such utterances on media that puts the govt in a tight position . We are likely to see more such Muslim world reactions when this govt tries to correct past intentional , malafide , detrimental to Hindus policies and decisions in our own country . I feel proud of the govt for taking the right steps to contain the fallout .  I am a retired IAF officer . Our. people act against the country with very little provocation, this is the reason we need Pegasus , niceties of democracy be damned .\n",

You've also maintained that India disregards and vehemently criticizes US comments on India's human rights record. These two assertions seem contradictory: why does India care about the GCC because of both being part of the western alliance but care so little about the head of that same alliance?\n",

And the biggest irony is Taliban and Pakistan commenting on this issue. The point of discussion should also be on whether a party member or sympathiser’s view is the government’s view as in this case the government has not endorsed it. Curious to see how bjp and Modi is going to handle this going forward. Especially with CAA still to be implemented.\n",

And explained other factors such as the Indian diaspora working in the Gulf. You are completely wrong on this one. The only reason is high crude oil prices. BJP never bothered about its people more than gimmicks. E.G. Demonetization, GST, Etc. After Modi came to power he ran India simply through petro-economics. Meaning, buying cheap oil and selling it at higher prices and ran the country with that money. Unfortunately, due to high oil prices, Modi has ran out of steam. Now distancing any country, especially Iran will have dangerous consequences as the Gulf already making money selling oil to other countries and Russia alone cannot satiate India's oil needs. Last 8 years the Gulf kept quiet despite Muslim persecution in India because of low crude prices. Now it's their time.  Next time please be precise, concise, and simple. Thanks\n",

And explained other factors such as the Indian diaspora working in the Gulf. You are completely wrong on this one. The only reason is high crude oil prices. BJP never bothered about its people more than gimmicks. E.G. Demonetization, GST, Etc. After Modi came to power he ran India simply through petro-economics. Meaning, buying cheap oil and selling it at higher prices and ran the country with that money. Unfortunately, due to high oil prices, Modi has ran out of steam. Now distancing any country, especially Iran will have dangerous consequences as the Gulf already making money selling oil to other countries and Russia alone cannot satiate India's oil needs. Last 8 years the Gulf kept quiet despite Muslim persecution in India because of low crude prices. Now it's their time.  Next time please be precise, concise, and simple. Thanks</td>\n",
